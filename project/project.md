## 1. Introduction

Wearables have been on the market for years now, gradually improving and providing increasingly insightful data on user health metrics. Most wearables contain an array of sensors allowing the user to track aspects of their physical health. This includes heart rate, motion, calories burned, and some devices now support ECG and BMI measurements. This vast trove of data is valuable to consumers, as it allows for the measurement and gamification of key health metrics. But can this data also be useful for health professionals in determining a patientâ€™s activity levels and tracing important events in their health history?


## 2. Background Research and Previous Work

Previous work exists on the use of sensors and wearables in assisted living environments.  Consumer wearables are commonplace and have been used primarily for tracking individual activity metrics.  This research attempts to establish the efficacy of these devices in providing useful data for user activity, and how this information could be useful for healthcare workers.  This paper examines the roadblocks in making this information available to healthcare professionals and examines what wearable information is currently being used in healthcare.



## 3. Choice of Data-sets
The dataset used for this project contains labeled movement data from wearable devices.  The goal is to establish the potential for wearable devices to provide high-quality data to users and healthcare professionals.  

A dataset gathered from 24 individuals with Apple devices measuring attitude, gravity, acceleration, and rotation rate, will be used to determine user states.  The dataset is labeled with six states (walking downstairs, walking upstairs, sitting, standing, walking and jogging) and each gyroscopic sensor has several attributes describing its motion.  


If successful, this will show that wearables have a high potential for providing relevant information beyond exercise and fall tracking.  

## 4. Methodology
The analysis of relevant wearable data is undertaken to determine the accuracy of activity information.  This analysis will consist of a brief descriptive analysis of the motion tracking data, and will proceed with attempts to classify the labeled data using various classification methods (k-means, random forest, linear regression).

If a classification strategy of sufficient accuracy is possible, it will be determined that wearable data can potentially serve as a useful supplementary source of information to aid in establishing a patient's medical history.

Reviewing relevant literature is important to determine the current state of wearables research regarding usefulness to healthcare workers and user well-being.  Much of this research will be focused on determining the state of wearables in the healthcare industry and determining if there is a need for streamlined data transfer to healthcare professionals.
