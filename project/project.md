## 1. Introduction

Wearables have been on the market for years now, gradually improving and providing increasingly insightful data on user health metrics. Most wearables contain an array of sensors allowing the user to track aspects of their physical health. This includes heart rate, motion, calories burned, and some devices now support ECG and BMI measurements. This vast trove of data is valuable to consumers, as it allows for the measurement and gamification of key health metrics. But can this data also be useful for health professionals in determining a patient’s activity levels and tracing important events in their health history?


## 2. Background Research and Previous Work

## 3. Choice of Data-sets
The dataset used for this project contains labeled movement data from wearable devices.  The goal is to establish the potential for wearable devices to provide high-quality data to users and healthcare professionals.  

This data is obtained from a Chinese study tracking falls among elderly people [^2].  It contains information regarding the state of the user (standing, walking, lying down, falling), and the user's trajectory.  This data will be used to determine a given user's current state through classification methods.  
If successful, this will show that wearables have a high potential for providing relevant information beyond exercise and fall tracking.  

## 4. Methodology
The analysis of relevant wearable data is undertaken to determine the accuracy of activity information.  This analysis will consist of a brief descriptive analysis of the motion tracking data, and will proceed with attempts to classify the labeled data using various classification methods (k-means, random forest, linear regression).

If a classification strategy of sufficient accuracy is possible, it will be determined that wearable data can potentially serve as a useful supplementary source of information to aid in establishing a patient's medical history.

Reviewing relevant literature is important to determine the current state of wearables research regarding usefulness to healthcare workers and user well-being.  Much of this research will be focused on
